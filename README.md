# AI/ML quotes

This is a repo of AI/ML related quotes for no special purpose other than they sounded interesting to me and I wanted to keep a trace of them.

## Quotes

> "AI is the new electricity"

Andrew Ng - https://youtu.be/fgbBtnCvcDI

> "They (chatGPT) got a 1000 times more knowledge in 1% of the connections (compared to the human brain), which sort of confirm they have the better learning algorithm (backpropagation + the possibility to share weights changes between identical agents)"

Geoffrey Hinton - https://youtu.be/rGgGOccMEiY?t=1390

> "A person is 20 PFLOPS"

George Hotz - https://youtu.be/VHoW6j7LhYg?t=2882

> "Intelligence is compression"

George Hotz - https://youtu.be/vn9Dq24RDn8?t=1648

> "My bet is that I think there's less than 6 key insights that need to be made, each one of them could probably be written in the back of an enveloppe, we don't know what they are but when they are put together in concert with GPUs at scale and the data we all have access to, that we can make something that behaves like a human being or a living creature."

John Carmack - https://youtu.be/xLi83prR5fg?t=143

> "(About mechanistic interpretability) we have no idea how you write computer programs that could do things like generate poetry yet we have weights for a model, essentially a computer program that can do this, this deeply offends me and I would like to solve it."

Neel Nanda - https://youtu.be/dsjUDacBw8o?t=129

> "I've always been somebody that doesn't want to build stuff on lots of big computers because most people don't have lots of big computers and I hate creating stuff that most people can't use."

Jeremy Howard - https://youtu.be/5Sze3kHAZqE?t=1257

> "Throw away the idea of fine-tuning, there's no such thing, it's only continued pre-training (you need to keep including examples of everything you care about to prevent carastrophic forgetting)."

Jeremy Howard - https://youtu.be/5Sze3kHAZqE?t=2732

> "I’ve taken to imagining deep RL as a demon that’s deliberately misinterpreting your reward and actively searching for the laziest possible local optima."

Alexirpan - https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html

> "(in the context of emulating humans) assuming that the observable universe is void of extraterrestrial civilizations, then what hangs in the balance is at least 1e58 human lives, though the true number is probably larger. If we represent all the happiness experienced during one entire such life with a single teardrop of joy, then the happiness of these souls could fill and refill the Earth’s oceans every second, and keep doing so for a hundred billion billion millennia. It is really important that we make sure these truly are tears of joy."

Nick Bostrom - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence

> "Before the prospect of an intelligence explosion, we humans are like small children playing with a bomb. Such is the mismatch between the power of our plaything and the immaturity of our conduct. Superintelligence is a challenge for which we are not ready now and will not be ready for a long time. We have little idea when the detonation will occur, though if we hold the decide to our ear we can hear a faint ticking sound."

Nick Bostrom - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence

> "As soon as it works, no one calls it AI any more."

John McCarthy

> "I'm starting to put some small amount of probability on the possibility that we get fairly advanced AI that don't run out and build more advanced AI because they can't solve the alignment problem either [...]"

Eliezer Yudkowsky - https://youtu.be/3_YX6AgxxYw?t=2745

> "ML is the science of data compression, plus the science of selecting actions that lead to data that you can compress in a way that you didn't know, but you can learn"

Jürgen Schmidhuber - https://youtu.be/DP454c1K_vQ?t=3892

> "If you want to solve AGI you basically have to work on reinforcement learning. When there's no teacher, when the system itself explores the world and learns how it works and then learns to solve all kinds of problems without human feedback"

Jürgen Schmidhuber - https://youtu.be/DP454c1K_vQ?t=5739
