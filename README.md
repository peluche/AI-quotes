# AI/ML quotes

This is a repo of AI/ML related quotes for no special purpose other than they sounded interesting to me and I wanted to keep a trace of them.

> "AI is the new electricity" - Andrew Ng - https://youtu.be/fgbBtnCvcDI

> "They (chatGPT) got a 1000 times more knowledge in 1% of the connections (compared to the human brain), which sort of confirm they have the better learning algorithm (backpropagation + the possibility to share weights changes between identical agents)" - Geoffrey Hinton - https://youtu.be/rGgGOccMEiY?t=1390
